## Features

- Add, delete (soft), lend, and search books
- Search by title, author, year, or status
- Maintain multiple libraries in JSON format
- OCR integration to extract book data from scanned images
- Draw rectangles to OCR custom regions in an image
- Generate up to 1 million records for performance testing
- Full testing suite (unit, integration, system)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure Tesseract OCR is installed and in your system PATH.
Install Tesseract: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract?utm_source=chatgpt.com


### OCR Features

OCR allows you to extract text from images using pyocr and Pillow.

Modes:

Batch Mode: Automatically scans all images in ocr_images/ folder.

Manual Mode: Opens an image viewer. You can draw a rectangle to OCR a specific region.

Text is matched against your existing library, and if not found, you are prompted to add it.

### Running Tests

Navigate to the root directory and run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

This runs:

unit_test.py â†’ Verifies core model functions

integration_test.py â†’ Ensures model + GUI connect properly

system_test.py â†’ End-to-end UI + backend simulation

### How It Works

Click the "How It Works" button inside the GUI for an in-app walkthrough.

Or call the how_it_works() function from library_model.py directly in code.
